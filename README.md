## About

This is a simple homepage, written in PHP, to serve my needs.  I use it several times a day.  Its origin can be traced back to my former homepage, Google.com.  Initially, I found Google to be a great start-page, since it was always the same... until they started changing the Google logo to reflect notable days according to their lexicon.  This became a supreme source of distraction to me, but I bore it.

A couple years later, I got into crafting, and discovered instructables.com.  It's an amazing website with a stellar community of knowledge-sharing folks.  Unfortunately, their homepage is rife with distractions as well.

After a few instances like my instructables.com experience, I realized that most of my needs could be met by targeted site-searches, but there didn't seeem to be anything that could do this.  Firefox tries to do this, but I found it to be inflexible.
